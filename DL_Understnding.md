    Library designed for deep learning inference tasks on NVIDIA Jetson platforms. Includes pre-trained models and tools for performing tasks like object detection, classification, and segmentation. 


- What is the difference between Image Classification, Image Recognition, Object Detection, and Object Classification ?
  
    Image Classification --> classify entire image to a single class based on its content, from predefined set of classes. Uses DL models like CNNS. Suitable when want to determine what an image represents without necessarily identifying specific objects within it.

    Object Detection --> identifying objects & their locations by drawing bounding box around them, unlike Image Recognition. Uses DL models like SSD.
    

    Image Recognition --> broader term, involves understanding the content and context of the image, which could involve recognizing multiple objects, their locations, and even their spatial relationships within the image.

    Object Classification --> involves identifying and categorizing specific objects in an image one by one. Unlike image classification, where the entire image is labeled.
