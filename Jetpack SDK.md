NVIDIA JetPack SDK --> solution for building end-to-end accelerated AI applications.
    *end-to-end: entire process or workflow is covered without the need for manual intervention. In context of AI applications, this involves addressing all stages of the AI pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and inference.

    *accelerated: refers to the use of hardware accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to enhance the performance of AI tasks. These accelerators are designed to perform specific types of computations more efficiently than traditional CPUs.


JetPack can be installed or upgraded using a Debian package management tool running on Jetson.
